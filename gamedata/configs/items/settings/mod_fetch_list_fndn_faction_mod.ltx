; Lookup list for fetch items
;-----------------------------
; 
; How to call an item list from a fetch task:
; 	fetch_func = %=setup_fetch_task(simulation_task_1_fetch:supplies:1:4)%
; [supplies] is defined here, it contains suitable item sections for the task
; 
; Weapons:
; in Anomaly 1.5, fetch weapons tasks will pick weapons suitable for NPC's rank and faction preference
; Result will be a list that contain shared weapons from [weapons_"rank"] and [weapons_"preference"], so a novice duty guy will pick a weapon exists in [weapons_eastern] and [weapons_novice]
; If no proper result is found, it will pick a weapon from [weapons]
;
; Added support for tiered items (Balathruin)
; When a fetch item has a tier defined in its section, it will be picked during rotation if its tier suits NPC's rank
; section with value "true" here will ingore their original tier and get included for all npcs despite their ranks
; You can control suitable tiers per NPC's rank inside [fetch_tiers]
